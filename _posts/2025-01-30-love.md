description: me yapping about how much i'm in love 💗
---

omfg i'm so in love, i cant even begin to describe it. alright lets back up and get some lore now.
 
i started to go to this new school because my brother got kicked outa my old school, and it's been alright. there has been alot of pain from moving schools because the schedules were widely different. this led me to be stuck in choir even though i wish not to be in choir. 

choir is fun though! i do kinda enjoy the class even though i'm not a singer. it has made me expand my personal boundries and the teacher is awesome. 

some joys choir has gave me was a boy named shane. he's in "shane" (sorry i won't make dumb jokes i stole again.) but pretty chill. he kidnapped me and dragged me into robotics club. robotics is quite awseome and actually this saturday i have a competition to go to for robotics. 

speaking of meeting new kids, i fell in love. this girl, no names (i don't wanna leak her name!), has my heart. she is so beautiful, and has an awesome personailty. i can't stop thinking about her, and it might just be driving me nuts. i have never dated a girl in my life 😭 so this is very new to me. she doesn't know i like her and i'm scared to tell her or something. another thing i'm scared about is rejection. if she rejects me will i still be able to be friends? is it gonna be to embarrsing to just be friends? 

ughhh i dunno!!!! 😭 like i said before i've never dated a girl in my life so like i'm still a newbie. how do i date people y'know? how do i be a romantic person, or be a good boyfriend? why am i such an anxious person? it kills meeeeee. she's pan so that's cool. she makes me want to be a way better person too. she makes me feel like i have to break dumb and old habits, be funnier, and have a generally better personality. 

something embarassing happened the other day. she was talking to me and i had full interest but i was so scared that i was gonna screw up to the point where i kept looking around the room instead of her 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓾𝓽𝓲𝓯𝓾𝓵 eyes. i feel so shitty, and i dunno if she cared or not. my heart races when i'm around her and my heart is racing just writing this too. please help.

she's perfect, but in a imperfect way. everybody has their imperfections, but she is special as her imperfections make her perfect. i feel like i'm gonna cry now.

well i dunno, and thanks for reading. [heres a link.](https://uquiz.com/quiz/w6OPts/what-color-are-you?p=3651636)
