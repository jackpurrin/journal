lately, i've been feeling like i'm not good enough. i don't feel like i've been a good person at all.
i've also been thinking that my boyfriend doesn't actually like me and stuff. i feel like i've been pushed away kinda. 
i feel like my boyfriend would rather hang out with other people, and i'm scared that in the future they're just gonna love someone more.  i get scared that our relationship isn't going to last because they do things like simp over Call of Duty characters and people from bands. it makes me scared that one day someone will just come along in his life, and he will love them more. 
or the time during our lunch break in school, he kinda ignored me because he wanted to hang out with his other friends. i sometimes feel like i'm just a side person.
he keeps just leaving for long times and doesn't even tell me that they gotta go before they leave. i feel like he just is trying to run away from me.
