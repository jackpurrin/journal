## me

well i will fill this out later, but in the meantime, check out my website. it has my about page filled out. 

[here is the link!](https://jackpurrin.me/about)

## why was this website born?

well this website was born a couple months ago i belive. i can not name exactly when, i will add that later, but it has been a long time. 

i have this website because i love writing, i really do! and sometimes (a lot actually) i have a lot going on in my head, so i like to write to get it out. i usually write my ideas and stuff in my second brain i call ["logseq"](https://logseq.com). it has helped me clear my mind out a lot! but besides the point. the bigger thoughts and the ones i really wanna write about get put in this website, so that is one of the reasons why this website exists.

### what is this website?

this website is a real and personal look on life. it is a blog with just my thoughts and feelings. have you ever looked on the internet and see how perfect other people's lives seem? like go to a person's instagram account for example, all you are going to see is happiness and what they want you to see about thier lives. the internet is dominated by big companies and is not personal anymore. what happened to just personal websites? or just being able to see life as it is, not just the filtered and _perfect_ versions of peoples lives.

### what is this website for?

this website is all for free speech, a more personal internet, etc. will finish l8tr, it's getting late at night. 23:41

### what is this website against?

nowadays, ai generated slop content is overuling the internet. i just wanna watch a simple youtube video about something like minecraft without it being ai generated. ai is just a pile of junk and all of the content produced by it is total garbage, slop. it is not real, it does not look real, and it certainly is not good for us humans. 
- it is replacing real human work, reducing creativity. there is no soul or any diversity in ai generated content. it is all the same garbage.
- it has been used in school, getting people diplomas, making people dumber and learn less. where did basic human compresion go? ai is just pushing lazieness and students flock to ai instead of strethcing thier brains and learning.
- it has the risk to ruin our economy. big companies look for more money, and if they can use ai to replace workers instead of paying them, they would take the oppritunity.

so this website is a movement against how the internet is right now. real content, no filters, run by one person, not huge companies controlling what is said and posted, and no ai generated slop at all!!
