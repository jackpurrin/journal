## this website

### first reason why this website was born

well this website was born a couple months ago i belive. i can not name exactly when, i will add that later, but it has been a long time. 

i have this website because i love writing, i really do! and sometimes (a lot actually) i have a lot going on in my head, so i like to write to get it out. i usually write my ideas and stuff in my second brain i call ["logseq"](https://logseq.com). it has helped me clear my mind out a lot! but besides the point. the bigger thoughts and the ones i really wanna write about get put in this website, so that is one of the reasons why this website exists.

### second reason

you ever look at the internet and see how perfect other people's lives seem? like go to a person's instagram account for example, all you are going to see is happiness and what they want you to see about thier lives. the internet is dominatied by big compaines and is not real anymore. what happened to just personal websites? or just being able to see life as it is, not just the filtered and _perfect_ versions of peoples lives.

so this website is a movement against how the internet is right now. real content, no filters, run by one person, not huge companies controlling what is said and posted. if you wanna see more like this website, check out my homies out at [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev)!!
