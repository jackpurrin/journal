# welcome!

my name is **jackpurrin**! 
 
it's nice to see you on my website, i don't get many visitors. make my day and write in my [guestbook!](https://jackpurrin.me/guestbook) 

here i write about my thoughts, feelings, and ideas. a lot of posts about love, depression, and general topics. i'll soon write a post about my laptop...

other than writing, i spend a lot of my time programming, doing school, and learning ***ethical*** hacking.

i live in the USA in an alright state, arizona. it's pretty boring out here lol.
