## femtanyl

lately i have been all over femtanyl! she is currently my music addiction, sitting at 860 scrobbles on last.fm. something about the high energy music just makes something in my brain be happy. i haven't found anything like femtanyl yet and i would LOVE it if someone could tell me about an artist simmilar to her. i'm being serious, check out my contact page to find ways to tell me! i do use [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/hackpurrin) and i am aware of the simmilar artist feature but forwhatever reason, no one else really hits the way femtanyl does. my top three songs by here are

1. ATTACKING VERTICAL
2. S33K H3LP
3. MURDER 1 U YOU KNOW!

overall, she is a 11/10 (extra point for being trans) and i would totally recommend her to anyone who is into hardcore digital, breakcore, or just good music in general!
