# contact

okay i've got a couple of ways you can contact me!

- signal @`jackpurrin.92`
- email `me@jackpurrin.me`
- discord @`jackpurrin`

signal will be the most perferred.
email is the best if you do not have signal or can not use signal.
discord is iffy, i may or may not respond. i do not reccomend it but you can use it if you absolutely need to.
