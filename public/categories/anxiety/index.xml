      <description>&lt;p&gt;y&amp;rsquo;know how it feels when you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re important to someome signifigant? that&amp;rsquo;s how i&amp;rsquo;m feeling. it sucks, like a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-am-i-even-talking-about&#34;&gt;who am i even talking about?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so i&amp;rsquo;ve been dating this guy for around 3 months now. let&amp;rsquo;s call him &lt;code&gt;cuddles&lt;/code&gt; because he loves cuddles ðŸ˜– . cuddles is the same person i wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://log.jackpurrin.me/posts/love/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but he&amp;rsquo;s transgender (ftm). just said that for some context. recently, one of cuddles&amp;rsquo; friends has been dealing with some tough shit. let&amp;rsquo;s call this person &lt;code&gt;orange&lt;/code&gt; cuz they have orange hair. orange&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend is graduating high school and is moving on to college. she&amp;rsquo;s worried that his boyfriend is gonna get really high and forget she exists and fuck someome. so she&amp;rsquo;s been scared to break up with him. well, she&amp;rsquo;s been all up in my cuddles&amp;rsquo; ass and it&amp;rsquo;s been&amp;hellip; intresting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;promises&#34;&gt;promises&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;cuddles said that they would give me a five minuite hug yesterday. he said he would do it during our lunch break. also in the morning before they came to school, we were emailing. it was rainy outside and i asked if they wanted a kiss. i wanted to know if a kiss in the rain hits different. so he get to school. he say hi to me and the first thing they do is go to orange and discuss the drama. her and cuddles litterally ran away, and it seemed really embarrasing to follow my cuddles. i evantaully do because cuddles orange were getting breakfast. that kinda hurt that cuddles tried to leave without me, but whatever. other things would hurt more today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-kiss&#34;&gt;the kiss?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so the time rolls around for the kiss. we do our normal. we hug and i was about to kiss him. well that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen, they zip away. so that kinda sucked. i emailed him about it later if they were really comfortable with a kiss. he said yes, so i asked if he wanted to get a kiss after one of our classes when we see each other. he say &lt;code&gt;sure!&lt;/code&gt;.  that class rolls around, and it ends. same ritual, walk to class, get a hug, and lean in for a kiss. well again, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. orange was busy surrounding cuddles with her drama and it just got in the way. so i emailed again, &lt;code&gt;are you sure you&#39;re really comfortable with a kiss?&lt;/code&gt;. but no response this time. i figured class got in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-walk&#34;&gt;the walk&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;well my math class passes by, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to walk sammy to thier biology class. so i walk them. after i take them to class, i usually hug them. there&amp;rsquo;s three bells at our school, end of class, get to class, and late bell. well the second bell rings during our hug. a hug that lasted a total of one second. they zip to class and i yell &lt;code&gt;you have 3 minutes left!&lt;/code&gt;. but they didn&amp;rsquo;t hear me. whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lunch-time&#34;&gt;lunch time!!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i go to my class, and it passes. slowly of course, but passes. it was lunch time! finally, time for a big and long hug! lunch ends at like 1:15. so we do normal lunch things, but the whole entire time, cuddles was again absorbed by orange&amp;rsquo;s bullshit. i ask him at 1, &lt;code&gt;hey are you still up for the five min hug?&lt;/code&gt; he say yeah. he don&amp;rsquo;t reach in for a hug, but i assume we&amp;rsquo;ll do it in a sec. 1 min passes, then two, then 5, then 10. i ask him again, &lt;code&gt;do you want a hug?&lt;/code&gt; and they say &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt;. what? so i didn&amp;rsquo;t get that hug i was promised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-is-slowww&#34;&gt;time is slowww&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;after that, i go to my next class. it passes, that one is without cuddles. well the next occcurs, and it the class at the end of the day. i have that one with cuddles! well the entire class long, he were sucked into a conversation with someone else. all class long. it absolutely fucking sucked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;end-of-the-day&#34;&gt;end of the day&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;class ends and i usually walk cuddles to his bus. i walk home so it usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal. orange appears out of the blue and again, surrounds cuddles. i try my best to get a good hug from cuddles, and maybe that kiss? i mean the hug was alright but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that great. and again, he didn&amp;rsquo;t kiss me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do anymore. this just sucks and i hate it. and i feel selfish to ask for some attention or to take away cuddles from what they consider more important for just some time with me and him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;well that&amp;rsquo;s my story of my day, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
