      <description>&lt;p&gt;i really just feel like my life is not going to end well. i won&amp;rsquo;t be sucsuessful, i won&amp;rsquo;t be able to have what i want or need, and i wont be able to actually have a good life. i mean like i can&amp;rsquo;t get a job, i can barely get a good education, and i just can&amp;rsquo;t really be happy. i&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to be happy and it&amp;rsquo;s taken it&amp;rsquo;s toll on me. i&amp;rsquo;ve been stressed to shit having to deal with summer school and stuff, i&amp;rsquo;ve felt really lonely lately, and i&amp;rsquo;ve been so bored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jobs&#34;&gt;jobs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; a passion for cybersecurity and programming, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it anymore. A.I. is taking over our economy and companies would rather pay for cheap robots than real humans. i love it and all, and before A.I. i wanted to go professional, make it my life and job! not for the money, just pure passion. slowly but surely, all of the jobs in that feild will be taken over. whole people&amp;rsquo;s lives have been ruined because A.I. took it over. gone for greed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;education&#34;&gt;education&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i really wanted to go to college, not a crazy ivy leauge school, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asu.edu/&#34;&gt;ASU&lt;/a&gt;. this has been a problem for a while, so not a new one, but how will i ever go to college if i can&amp;rsquo;t afford the price? it ties back to the jobs, i can&amp;rsquo;t afford collge with a deadbeat job i&amp;rsquo;ll never even apply the education for.&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started on grade school&amp;hellip; these gen-alpha kids and new freshmen are absolute pieces of shit! they treat their teachers like shit, they don&amp;rsquo;t learn, and they are super annoying. when i was a freshmen, even then most of the freshmen were assholes. it&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that kids can act like that to teachers and people of authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;home&#34;&gt;home&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;house prices have been skyrocketing, and not just buying a house. renting something like an apartment is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; expensive. i don&amp;rsquo;t want to live in my parents&amp;rsquo; house for very long. i want to get out but i just can&amp;rsquo;t. arizona used to be cheap but like everywhere else, it got expensive as fuck. i don&amp;rsquo;t mind living in an apartment but it&amp;rsquo;s just too expensive. i just can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how expensive it will be by the time where i&amp;rsquo;m old enough to move out. it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-things&#34;&gt;other things&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;like politics. i absolutely hate politics, but from what i&amp;rsquo;ve heard, it does not sound like the USA is going to be a chill place to live in anymore. passing crazy bills that will be dangerous for the people, doing things that make america feel more like a dictatorship, and ruining our human rights. e.g. donald trump suing WSJ for making an article about the epstien stuff or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i mean like i don&amp;rsquo;t even know anymore. thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
