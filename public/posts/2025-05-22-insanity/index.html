  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>i really do not know how to start this. it is kinda funny to think just two days ago i was writing about <a href="https://log.jackpurrin.me/posts/lovesick/">how lovesick i am</a>. how silly :/</p>
<h2 id="we-were-still-friends">we were still friends<a href="#we-were-still-friends" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>so after me and cuddles broke up, we were still friends. you can read more about the breakup <a href="https://log.jackpurrin.me/posts/heartbreak/">here</a>. it was hella awkward being friends tho. it felt off to be around him. the best way i can describe how i felt when i saw him was <code>jealous</code> and <code>lovesick</code>. hours go by, i did not get over him. days go by. hell even like two weeks went by and i still was not over him. we broke up around the end of the school year, and school ended today actually! so i hoped it would be easier to get over him over the summer. especially because i believed i was never going to see him again because he were moving to another school. it was also kinda sad to think about.</p>
<h2 id="i-was-still-in-love-and-so-was-he">i was still in love, and so was he.<a href="#i-was-still-in-love-and-so-was-he" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>for some context, a week or two after the breakup, we were talking and he said he regretted breaking up with me. he said he wanted to stay reserved for me while he still went to his new school. he also admitted to still be loving me. i also still loved him. that sounded nice and all but i have serious trust issues. so i asked what was the ratio between how much he wanted to be with me and how much of it was just to make me happy. he said 50/50. so i said it would just be better to stay as friends. but we both still loved each other.</p>
<h2 id="summer-break">summer break<a href="#summer-break" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>so like i said earlier, summer break started today. even though it has only been a day, summer break has been boring as hell. he was the only person keeping my sanity in check though. he was pretty much the only person i texted, other than like one or two friends. today while i was in the shower, i was thinking about what if cuddles did not move schools? and so after that shower i was talking to cuddles about being lovesick and shit. we were both lovesick and was just talking about it. well he broke some awesome news. good news for me, and good news for him.</p>
<h2 id="awesome-news">awesome news<a href="#awesome-news" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>the same day cuddles said he would never see me or any of his friends again because he was moving schools is the same day he the said that his mom was letting him stay at my school instead of the one he was gonna move to!!! and we were already talking about our relationship, and he says something that catches me so off guard. we were talking about some stuff, like some relationship retrospective. during that conversation he brung up that his mom is letting him stay at my school. that changed our conversation wildly. well we kept talking, and instead of saying <code>okay</code> or something like that, he said <code>okay my dear</code>. i immediately am thinking <code>oh my fucking god. no fucking way he said that.</code> and <code>am i dreaming? is this real?</code> and <code>is he saying what i think he is saying? are we dating again?!?!?!</code></p>
<h2 id="i-ask">i ask<a href="#i-ask" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i asked him if he wanted to stay reserved for me for a little while, and he says <code>it is just staying reserved</code>. when i asked about being resevred, i also mentioned being scared to say something. the thing in question was <code>so since you said **okay my dear** it got me thinking that you were hinting at dating me again</code>. and his response to that was <code>not officaly.</code>. i am so fucking excitedddd!!! also, the reason why i got so amped up about him calling me dear is because while we were dating, he knew my favorite name to be called was <code>my dear</code> behind <code>good boy</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-he-has-been-treating-me">how he has been treating me<a href="#how-he-has-been-treating-me" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>well like, he has been treating me like were actually dating, and over the summer i hope we will actually be offically be dating!! like yeah we have both been using the pet names, but he has also been saying things like how much he wants to kiss me, and like how much he desires my cuddles. i will admit i have been saying the same stuff back, but it is not like it is bad that we have been saying that stuff. it just seems like we are offically dating.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes">mistakes<a href="#mistakes" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i hope we will have learned from our mistakes, the both of us. i need to learn to be less pushy, and he also needed to learn to communicate better. if he had communicated how he was feeling about our realtionship when he did not feel like he was mentally stable enough to be in a realtionshp, we could have talked it out. he did not feel stable enough to make sure i felt seen and got what i wanted from him. if he told me that, i would have asked for less, and it would have been okay with me! becase true love is making sacrifcies.</p>
<p>well yeah, that is pretty much it. thanks for reading, and make sure to leave a reaction/comment below so i can see your guy&rsquo;s feedback!!</p>
