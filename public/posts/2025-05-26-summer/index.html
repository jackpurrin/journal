        <p>well summer break started this thursday! i mean like some good things happened, read about it <a href="https://log.jackpurrin.me/posts/insanity">here</a>, but it&rsquo;s also slow as hell.</p>
<h2 id="school">school<a href="#school" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>well before summer break, i had stuff to do and things to be exited for in the day. i had friends to hang out with, i had classes to look forward to, it was something to pass the time. i was not just sitting down at my computer all day, doing nothing. it made me a more active person. i have to walk to school, and on top off that i had pe so there was plenty of things that kept my step count above 10 thousand. (yes, i will prove it if you do not belive me) i will admit though, school was not all sunshine and rainbows though. if i am being honest, it had made my mental state 100 times worse. of course, i had the constant stress and anxiety caused by some people. for example, this girl i will call orange, stirred up constant drama and could never seem to find a end to her fucking problems. so she just took it out on us. i also had the stress of school work. i am a gifted student, i do well in school! turns out one of my favorite subjects was the one that was the most stressful unfortunately. my ela teacher gave me so much work, and i have been dealing with burnout from mental problems, so it was hard to do the amount of work she gave me.</p>
<h2 id="an-escape">an escape<a href="#an-escape" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>school was also an escape from home. some of the things it gave me an escape from</p>
<ul>
<li>brother being an asshole</li>
<li>i walk on eggshells at home. my stepdad can get aggressive at times. with no warning.</li>
<li>i have a lot of work to do at home, like constant dishes</li>
<li>literally an escape. my parents do not usually take us out of the house, so school was my way to leave.</li>
<li>an escape from the bordem of being home. days blur together, there is not much to do at home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="younger-times">younger times<a href="#younger-times" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>when i was younger, i never had problems with the house being boring. partly because when i was younger, i had shows to watch, i had games i liked to play, and i was also able to go to my dad&rsquo;s house. his house actually had fun things to do that were not screens. and also he had cats, and as you could guess, i  love cats. plenty of things to do! but because of unfortunate circumstances, i do not see my dad much anymore, i do not find joy in playing many games, and my mom cancelled all of her subscriptions because she wanted DVDs instead. so no anime üòø.</p>
<h2 id="winter-break">winter break<a href="#winter-break" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>winter break is relevant because it shows what could happen to me during summer break. winter break was two weeks long. summer break is usually ten weeks long. so therefore, the effects would be five times stronger. i was lonely, i was numb, and i was unfortunately suicidal. i had no one to hang out with, i had nothing to do, i felt like my life had no meaning. i felt like i was wasting my time doing literally nothing. i could have been doing so much more, like hanging out with friends at the mall, or trying to make friends at public places like parks. but my parents would not have done that. but winter break kinda changed me for the better. at my old school i was kinda the quiet kid, but i knew a couple kids. after that i became a bit more social. but some of those mental problems kind of stuck with me after winter break.</p>
<h2 id="this-summer">this summer<a href="#this-summer" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>even though it only has been a couple of days, it has been boring. but some good things happened like i mentioned earlier. this summer break i have one friend i can hang out with though! {insert is github if he is okay with it}. i have not really had much to do at all. i do have some sort of goals for the summer but they feel so out of reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>try and go on a walk every day</li>
<li>read more, i like gay romance (or just straight romance) üòä</li>
<li>convince my mom to let me go to the library more</li>
<li>try and learn the guitar</li>
<li>try and learn to draw</li>
<li>learn photogrophy and videography</li>
<li>fix my sleep schedule</li>
<li>find a way to get some cash</li>
<li>write more!!</li>
<li>do some more cooking</li>
<li>and convince my mother to take us to california</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mental-health">mental health<a href="#mental-health" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>i just really hope that my mental health wont degrade again. it is already at a bad spot, constant anxiety, stress, not feeling happy much, etc. and i am scared summer might just make it worse. i have to push my mom to let us do things, and my mom is trying to get a new job (got laid off a while ago) so she might not even have time to do stuff. both stepdad and mom should be employed so no parents can really do much. being isolated much is not good, but hopefully i can have a friend over sometimes. i have goals to keep myself occupied but i do not know how long those should last and it may just lead me to being bored again and i already feel like i am wasting so much time. really though, what am i doing? i would never commit but like thoughts sometimes come by and it scared the living shit out of me. i just hope soon i can get the help i need and summer will be over quickly. then i can have a purpouse again.</p>
<p>well thanks for reading, leave a reaction and comment to show your support! or just leave some feedback!</p>
